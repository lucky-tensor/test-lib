## 5.0.4
V5.0.4 requires a hot network upgrade.

The stdlib payload hash for voting is: 546f67a5fa38f2a488934cb169e2e19f4a63d65cf751816d53a89f459c04bea2

### Summary
v5.0.4 includes tx scripts to enable "community wallets" to send payments to "slow wallets"

### Changes

##### Move Changes

##### - Community wallet transfer transaction script 

Community wallets have a specific transfer mechanism. Transactions are not immediate, they are proposed, and after 3 epochs (days) the transaction posts. This allows time for reviewers of the wallet (the validator set normally) to slow down the transaction further (1 epoch per veto), and with sufficient vetos the tx gets rejected. This logic was already implemented in the state machine, however it lacked the cli tools and API to execute the transaction. This change creates the Move (tranaction script) and Rust (TXS app subcommand).

Functional test was created for the Move tx scriopt.

An integration test for command line tools was created ./ol/integraion-tests/test-tx-tools.mk

##### Compatibility
The Move framework is backwards compatible with `diem-node` from v5.0.1

### Rust changes
Changes are isolated to ./ol/txs transaction sending tool, not to any consensus modules.

NOTE If you have not yet upgraded to previous versions (e.g. v5.0.2) there is a critical upgrade to `diem-node`. It's safe to skip 5.0.2 directly to 5.0.4 if that upgrade was not yet done.
