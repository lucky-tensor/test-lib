## 5.2.0

This upgrade impacts Carpe, Stdlib, and Node binaries.

Upgrade steps:
1. Roll out Carpe updates to users (backwards compatible with 5.1.2 chain)
2. Vote on Move stdlib upgrade
3. Validator operators deploy new binaries (backwards compatible with 5.1.2 chain)
4. Validators update config files


## Deployment

### Vote on stdlib

The stdlib payload hash for voting is: 2a8ae2cdd6f9cb941332d521380a681785f406af4e2b788da6132d46f7524172


Execute a lazy vote from a validator in the validator set with:
`txs oracle-upgrade --vote -h 2a8ae2cdd6f9cb941332d521380a681785f406af4e2b788da6132d46f7524172`

Or build from source and vote:
```
cd libra
make stdlib
txs oracle-upgrade --vote -f <path to stdlib.mv shown above>

```

### Upgrade Node

#### Install Binaries

The usual upgrade can be done from source with
```
killall diem-node tower ol
cd libra
make bins install
```

#### Update config files
You will want to use new validator.node.yaml, which is universal -- no need to switch between fullnode and validator mode. It also includes some minor parameter changes.

Write the new validator yaml file is a single command.
```
ol init --val

```

v5.2.0 standardizes the chain_id field of the 0L.toml file. You may have an issue starting `ol` and `tower`. Edit the 0L.toml file and set the chain_id to "MAINNET".

```
[chain_info]
chain_id = "MAINNET"

```

#### Restarting the validator
`ol start` is now considered stable. It is a daemon that you can use the start tool to manage the different services (web monitor, tower, diem-node) and restart them. Assuming you can start your node once normally (`diem-node -f ~/.0L/validator.node.yaml`) without errors, you can attempt to use it.

It's one command:
```
ol start

# In another terminal you can tail the logs
tail -f ~/.0L/logs/node.log
tail -f ~/.0L/logs/tower.log
```
