## 5.2.0

This upgrade impacts Carpe, Stdlib, and Node binaries.

Upgrade steps:
1. Roll out Carpe updates to users (backwards compatible with 5.1.2 chain)
2. Validator operators deploy new binaries (backwards compatible with 5.1.2 chain)
2. Vote Stdlib upgrade

## Deployment

There is no need to update rust binaries.

The stdlib payload hash for voting is: cc5c2236b1cd22cb82654ef2d62e01835498bed9d1c356c8157b061b78a2fe26


Execute a lazy vote from a validator in the validator set with:
`txs oracle-upgrade --vote -h cc5c2236b1cd22cb82654ef2d62e01835498bed9d1c356c8157b061b78a2fe26`

Or build from source and vote:
```
cd libra
make stdlib
txs oracle-upgrade --vote -f <path to stdlib.mv shown above>

```
