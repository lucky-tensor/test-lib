// MultiSig
// A payment tool for transfers which require n-of-m approvals
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


// The main design goals of this multisig implementation are:
// 0 . Leverages MultiSig library which allows for arbitrary transaction types to be handled by the multisig. This is a payments implementation.
// 1. should leverage the usual transaction flow and tools which users are familiar with to add funds to the account. The funds remain viewable by the usual tools for viewing account balances.
// 2. The authority over the address should not require collecting signatures offline: transactions should be submitted directly to the contract.
// 3. Funds are disbursed as usual: to a destination addresses, and not into any intermediate structures.
// 4. Does not pool funds into a custodian contract (like gnosis-type implementations)
// 5. Uses the shared security of the root address, and as such charge a fee for this benefit.

// Custody
// This multisig implementation does not custody funds in a central address (the MultiSig smart contract address does not pool funds).

// The multisig funds exist on a remote address, the address of the creator.
// This implies some safety features which need to be implemented to prevent the creator from having undue influence over the multisig after it has been created.

// No Segregation
// Once the account is created, and intantiated as a multisig, the funds remain in the ordinary data structure for coins. There is no intermediary data structure which holds the coins, neither on the account address, nor in the smart contract address.
// This means that all existing tools for sending transfers to this account will execute as usual. All tools and APIs which read balances will work as usual.

// 0L MultiSig module
// Third party multisig apps are possible, but either they will use a custodial model, use segrated structures on a sender account (where the signer may always have authority), or they will require the user to collect signatures offline.
// A third party multisig app could achieve the design goals above also by Leveraging the MultiSig contract. Achieving it requires tight coupling to the DiemAccount tools, and VM authority.

// Root Security
// This contract can simply be cloned, and a third party may offer a multisig service. Though we expect people to use the service with the highest level of guarantees, and least amount of effor to use. 
// Using MultiSigPayment means leveraging "Root Security".
// This service has the highest level of security in the system, a shared Root Security. The account which creates this multisig (sponsor), immediately has their authorization key "bricked" such that it cannot issue any type of transaction to the account. The authorities are the only one that can issue transactions. Since this code is published to the 0x0 address, it cannot be changed, unles by protocol upgrade, thus it has the highest level of security. 

// Fees
// Since this contract offers Root Security, this is a benefit provided collectively, and as such there is a fee for this service. 

// The fee is paid to the root address, and is used to pay for the security from consensus (validator rewards). The fee is a percentage of the funds added to the multisig.

// Authorities
// What changes from a vanilla 0L Address that the "signer" for the account loses access to that account. And instead the funds are controlled by the Multisig logic. The implementation of this is that the account's AuthKey is rotated to a random number, and the signer for the account is removed, forcing the signer to lose control. As such the sender needs to THINK CAREFULLY about the initial set of authorities on this address.
