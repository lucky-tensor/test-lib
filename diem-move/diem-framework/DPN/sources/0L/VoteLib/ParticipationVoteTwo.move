  module TurnoutTally {

    // TurnoutTally is a module that constructs a TallyType, for use with VoteLib's Ballot module. It does not store any state itself, you'll need to import it into a module.

    // The tally design single issue referendum, with only votes in favor or against, but with an adaptive threshold for the vote to pass.

    // The design of the policies attempts to accomodate online voting where votes tend to happen:
    // 1. publicly
    // 2. asynchronously
    // 3. with a low turnout
    // 4. of voters with high conviction

    // Low turnouts are not indicative of disinterest (often termed voter apathy), but instead it is just "rational ignorance" of the matters being voted. Adaptive deadlines and thresholds are an attempt to encourage more familiarity with the matters, and thus more participation. At the same time it allows for consensus decisions to be reached in a timely manner by the active and interested participants.

    // The ballots have dynamic deadlines and thresholds.
    // deadlines can be extended by dissenting votes from the current majority vote. This cannot be done indefinitely, as the extension is capped by the max_deadline.
    // The threshold (percent approval/rejection which needs to be met) is determined post-hoc. Referenda are expensive, for communities, leaders, and voters. Instead of scapping a vote which doesn't achieve a pre-established number of participants (quorum), the vote is allowed to be tallied and be seen as valid. However, the threshold must be higher (more than 51%) in cases where the turnout is low. In blockchain polkadot network has prior art for this: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-governance#adaptive-quorum-biasing
    // In Polkadot implementation there are positive and negative biasing. Negative biasing (when turnout is low, a lower amount of votes is needed) seems to be an edge case.

    // Regarding deadlines. The problem with adaptive thresholds is that it favors the engaged community. If you are unaware of the process, or if the process occurred silently, it's very challenging to swing the vote. So the minority vote may be disadvantaged due to lack of engagement, and there should be some accomodation. If they are coming late to the vote, AND in significant numbers, then they can get an extension. The initial design aims to allow an extension if on the day the poll closes, a sufficient amount of the vote was shifted in the minority direction, an extra day is added. This will happen for each new deadline.

    // THE BALLOT
    // Ballot is a single proposal that can be voted on.
    // Each ballot will run for the minimum period of time.
    // The deadline can be extended with dissenting votes from the current majority vote.
    // The turnout can be extended with dissenting votes from the current majority vote.
    // the threshold is dictated by the turnout. In this implementation the curve is fixed, and linear.
    // At 1/8th turnout, the threshold to be met is 100%
    // At 7/8th turnout, the threshold to be met is 51%
