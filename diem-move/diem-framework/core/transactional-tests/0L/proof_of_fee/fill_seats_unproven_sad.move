// Scenario: Here we have 6 validators and 4 seats, but only 4 come
// from the previous epoch.
// This time Eve and Frank are "unproven nodes", they also happen
// to have the highest bids.
// They have all placed bids, per TestFixtures::pof_default().

// At 4 seats, we only have space for 1 unproven node.
// It should be Frank that gets seated.
// Eve will not be seated at all, even though she has a higher bid
// than the proven nodes.

// The clearing price will not change. The lowest is still Alice
// who is also seated.

/// For all lists we are using the validators in the ValidatorUniverse
/// the desired validator set is the same size as the universe.
/// All validators in the universe are properly configured
/// All validators performed perfectly in the previous epoch.
