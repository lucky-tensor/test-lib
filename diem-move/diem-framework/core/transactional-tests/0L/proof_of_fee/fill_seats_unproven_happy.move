//# init --validators Alice Bob Carol Dave Eve Frank


// Scenario: Here we have 6 validators and 6 seats, but only 4 come
// from the previous epoch.
// They have all placed bids, per TestFixtures::pof_default().

// However Alice and Bob have not been in the last epoch's set.
// So we consider them "unproven".
// Alice and Bob happen to also be the lowest bidders. But we will
// seat them, and their bids will count toward getting the clearing price.

// In this scenario there will be sufficient seats. 
// We will open up 2 seats (1/3 of 6 seats).
// As such both Eve and Frank should be seated.

// The clearing price will not change. The lowest is still alice
// who is also seated.


/// For all lists we are using the validators in the ValidatorUniverse
/// the desired validator set is the same size as the universe.
/// All validators in the universe are properly configured
/// All validators performed perfectly in the previous epoch.
