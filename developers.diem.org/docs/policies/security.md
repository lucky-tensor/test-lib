title: Reporting Vulnerabilities
---

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Diem project.

> **Note**: As Diem Core is currently in the prototype stage and does not power a blockchain with a cryptocurrency that has real-world value, our security procedures are not fully in place. We will release a more complete disclosure policy prior to the launch of the mainnet.

## Reporting a Bug

The Diem team and community take all security bugs in the Diem project
seriously to ensure the security of the Diem Blockchain.


Please report security bugs on [Diemâ€™s Bug Bounty with HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/diem).

You can also report security bugs by emailing us directly at [security@diem.org](mailto:security@diem.org).

Thank you for improving the security of the Diem Blockchain! Your efforts and responsible disclosure are appreciated, and every effort will be made to acknowledge your contributions in a timely manner.
